# openai_health_chatbot

**Welcome to the OpenAI Health Chatbot Repository!**

This repository contains the Python and HTML code necessary to build a user-friendly interface for interacting with an AI model trained on a health-related dataset. The Python code fetches user inputs and sends them to the AI model for processing. The AI model then generates a response, which is displayed in the HTML interface.

## Getting Started

To use this chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the Python code with your actual OpenAI API key.
2. Modify the code based on the specific AI model or dataset you choose to use.

## Chatbot Interface

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains a basic chatbot interface, complete with:

- An input field for the user to type their messages.
- A send button to submit user inputs.

The Python code communicates with the AI model through the OpenAI API, while the HTML file handles the user interface and display of chat messages.

## Usage

This is a simple implementation designed for experimentation and learning. Before deploying it in a production environment, thoroughly test the chatbot to ensure it meets your requirements.

## Deployment

Deploy this chatbot using any cloud provider or your own server. Ensure that the API key for the AI model is securely stored and not exposed to the client.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may not be suitable for all use cases.
